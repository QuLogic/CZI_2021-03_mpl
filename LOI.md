# Proposal purpose

> Limit to one sentence (maximum of 255 characters, including spaces)

> 169 characters

To support the continued maintenance, growth, development, and community
engagement of Matplotlib, the foundational plotting library of the Scientific
Python Ecosystem.


## Round 3 version

To enable Matplotlib to continue as the core plotting library of the Scientific
Python Ecosystem, we will address the maintenance backlog and continue
Matplotlib's evolution to meet the communityâ€™s visualization challenges for the
next decade.


# Proposal Summary/Scope of Work (required):

> Provide a short summary of the application (maximum of 500 words)

> currently 510 words

Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific
Python Ecosystem, with over a million users, including researchers in
bio-medical imaging, microscopy, and genomics.  For the past 18 years
Matplotlib has been maintained by a vibrant, primarily volunteer, community.
However we have grown too big and widely used to continue on solely volunteer
effort.  For the past 15 months (via EOSS Round 1 and 3) we have had supported
developers which has had a huge positive effect on the project;  We propose to
continue this effort.

The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of the
library.  Maintenance covers a wide range of tasks including triaging and
fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, tagging and building
releases, and keeping the continuous integration services running.  These tasks
are essential for the project's health; though each individually is small, they
are frequently time critical and tedious.  It is unfair and impractical to rely
solely on volunteers to accomplish such tasks.

In particular, reviewing new Issues and PRs was task that, with only volunteer
effort, we could not keep up with leading to an ever growing backlog.  There
may be critical bug reports or insightful feature requests among the issues,
while among the PRs there may be useful contributions or bug fixes that would
improve Matplotlib.  Further, the backlog is discouraging for new and
occasional contributors and distracting for core developers.

Having maintenance tasks promptly and reliably addressed and reducing the
Issue/PR backlog improve the contribution experience for everyone working on
the project.  We propose to devote three quarters of a developer's time to
continue handling these tasks.

In addition to on-going and routine maintenance, there are substantial, but
incremental, enhancement to Matplotlib that require long blocks of dedicated
work to implement.  Examples of this work include fixing long-standing
rendering and performance issues, deep-dive explanatory documentation,
homogenizing and smoothing the API, and new user-facing functionality.  Without
funding, this type of project can drag out for months to years or stall
altogether.  We propose to complete 4 such medium-sized self-contained projects
per year with about 25% of an FTE.  The exact projects will be selected in
consultation with down-stream biomedical libraries.


Finally, supported developers improve the technical and community management of
the project.  We now have the time and bandwidth to make strategic decisions
about the direction of the project to ensure the long term health and viability
of Matplotlib.  However, it is critical that Matplotlib remain a
community-driven project and the supported developers must complement and
enable, not replace, volunteer work.  Individuals participate in our
community at all levels of engagement; from users who only want to read the
documentation to developers who are co-creating the library and everything in
between.  We must ensure that our community is open and welcoming to everyone
who wants to join and that there are clear paths for people to change their
role within community.  We propose dedicating a 20% FTE to management and
community maintenance, including planning, governance, outreach,
communications, and moderation.

Matplotlib is the most widely used and de-facto standard visualization library
in Python (over 1M monthly users) and is a mature library (18+ years old) with
over 1,250 individual code contributors.  In addition to being directly used by
scientists, it is a core dependency of libraries and applications that
implement domain-specific visualizations. To aid users in discovering these
extensions we have been assigned a Trove classifier on PyPI [1].

Given the centrality of visualization to data analysis across all domains, no
single tool can satisfy all needs.  There are a range of tools not built on
Matplotlib (see https://pyviz.org/tools.html for a long but not exhaustive
list) that target use cases that Matplotlib is not well suited for.

Visualization is fundamental to science across all domains, including
biomedical, and Matplotlib is the foundational plotting library in the
scientific Python Ecosystem.  As a general-purpose plotting library Matplotlib
is used to build domain specific visualization by researches across the
biomedical research community, both directly and indirectly via tools that
implement domain-specific visualizations.  This tools including CZI funded
projects scikit-learn, CellProfiler, scanpy, starfish, nipy, networkx,
MNE-python, DeepCutLab, pandas, xarary, and scikit-image.  Supporting the
maintenance of Matplotlib will support researchers across the biomedical
complex.
