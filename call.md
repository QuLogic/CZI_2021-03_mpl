# Overview

Open source software is critical to modern scientific research, advancing
biology and medicine while providing reproducibility and transparency. Hundreds
of software packages, libraries, and applications have become essential tools
for research—so much so that many researchers could not continue their work
without them. Despite its importance, even the most widely-used research
software often lacks dedicated funding for maintenance, growth, development,
and community engagement. Also, those who work on such software often lack
credit and recognition.

In an effort to support open source software for science, the Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative (CZI) seeks letters of intent to apply for funding for software
projects that are essential to biomedical research, have already demonstrated
impact, can show potential for continued improvement, and expect to deliver
added value to the biomedical research community through the proposed
activities.

Grants will be for two years and can be used to fund a variety of eligible
activities.

Note that previous cycles of Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS)
RFA required a full proposal at the time of application; this cycle will be a
two step process: an initial Letter of Intent (LOI), which will be followed by
invitations to a select number of applicants to submit a Full Application.

With this program, we aim to provide software projects with resources to
support their tools and the communities behind them. Whether it’s hiring an
additional developer, improving documentation, addressing usability, improving
compatibility, onboarding contributors, or convening a community, we hope our
support can help make the computational foundations of biological research more
usable and robust.

## Scope

CZI currently supports several areas of basic science and technology with the
goal of making it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end
of this century. This program aims to support software tools that are essential
to this mission. Applications for two broad categories of open source software
projects will be considered in scope:

Domain-specific software for analyzing, visualizing, and otherwise working with
the specific data types that arise in biomedical science (e.g., genomic
sequences, microscopy images, molecular structures). Software will be
considered out of scope if it primarily serves domains outside biomedical
science (e.g., physics, astronomy, earth sciences). While we appreciate that
other communities may want to explore new extensions of their software to the
life sciences, such applications are unlikely to be selected.  Foundational
tools and infrastructure that enable a wide variety of downstream software
across several domains of science and computational research (e.g., numerical
computation, data structures, workflows, reproducibility). While foundational
tools will be considered in scope for this program, they must have demonstrated
impact on some area(s) of biomedical research.  We strongly encourage proposals
requesting funding for multiple related software projects (example here). For
examples of open source projects we’ve previously funded through the EOSS
program, we encourage you to check the list of proposals awarded in the
previous cycles and our blog posts.

Examples of projects that are less likely to be successful:

- A project in its earlier stages that is not used extensively or known beyond
  the creator(s);
- A project that is focused on improving or supporting a database or knowledge
  base that has few community contributions or low adoption in the biomedical
  community;
- A project that is widely successful and adopted but has little or no
  applications to biomedicine;
- A proposal for a research project to mine, publish, or analyze research
  results rather than a project that will support the biomedical research
  process itself.
- Applications can request funding between $50k and $200k total costs per year
  for two years (inclusive of up to 15% for indirect/overhead costs) for an
  overall amount requested between $100k and $400k for the two-year duration of
  the grant (inclusive of 15% for indirect/overhead costs). At the LOI stage,
  proposals will not need to provide a detailed budget or justification. At the
  full proposal stage, budgets will be required and evaluated for
  appropriateness relative to the scope of work proposed.

Acceptable use of funds includes, but is not limited to:

- Salary support for staff (full-time, part-time, or contract): developers,
  contributors, technical writers, community managers, product managers,
  project managers, user experience researchers, community educators, or other
  roles that directly support the software project(s);
- Hackathons, sprints, outreach, or other forms of community engagement and
  support for community participation;
- Operational needs such as cloud computing, storage, networking, or continuous
  integration services; and
- Support for work that bridges software projects or ecosystems, including
  better coordination across software projects that are similar, dependent on
  one another, or frequently used together.
- CZI staff will further support awarded proposals by convening grantee
  meetings and helping connect open source software developers to scientists —
  including other CZI-funded grantees and members of the broader scientific
  community.

# Application Requirements


## Application process:

The EOSS-4 application process is a two-step process: Letter of Intent (LOI)
and Full Application (if invited).

Award period and start date: Awards will be for two years (24 months) in
duration with a start date of no earlier than September 1, 2021. Actual start
date may vary. No-cost extensions will be considered at the end of the grant
period.

## Budget:

Applications can request funding between $50k and $200k total costs per
year for two years (inclusive of up to 15% for indirect/overhead costs) for a
total amount requested between $100k and $400k for the two-year duration of the
grant (inclusive of 15% for indirect/overhead costs). Budgets will be evaluated
for appropriateness relative to the scope of work proposed. Indirect costs
cannot exceed 15% of direct costs. A detailed budget is not required at the LOI
stage.

## Application Specifics

All Letters of Intent must be completed and submitted through the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative’s online grants management portal. We recommend that you
familiarize yourself with this portal well in advance of the submission
deadlines.

In the first phase, we invite Letters of Intent (LOI) where applicants will
provide:

- a short proposal detailing the project(s) for which funding is being sought
- the activities the funds would support, and a description of how the
  applicant and key personnel are well positioned to conduct them
- the desired outcomes for the grant, or what would result from this funding.

LOIs do not need a full budget, a finalized list of personnel, a set of
deliverables, or institutional sign-off.

A subset of the LOI applicants will be invited to submit a Full Application for
two year awards.

Full Applications for these supplemental grants will include:

- a description of the proposed activities to be funded, with a list of
  milestones and deliverables
- a list and short description of the open source software project(s) (up to
  five) involved in the proposal
- a full budget description
- a list of key personnel involved
- a description of recent institutional and financial support for the open
  source project(s) involved in the proposal
- a brief landscape analysis, describing other software tools (either
  proprietary or open source) that the audience for this proposal is primarily
  using and how the software projects in the proposal compare to these other
  tools in terms of user base size, usage, and maturity
- a description of the expected outcomes the proposal aims to support
- the value the outputs of the proposal will deliver to the biomedical research
  community
- a description of any qualitative and quantitative indicators and evaluation
  strategies the applicant intends to use to assess their progress towards
  these outcomes
- institutional sign-off (see Institutional Approval Form for details). Note
  sign-off is not required at LOI stage

Detailed application instructions are available below in the Detailed
Application Instructions section, as well as in the grants management portal.
